## Welcome to the Warrens repo.

This repository contains a python game called 'Warrens'. It is meant as a coding playground for me to have some fun with Python.

The GUI implementation is based on pygame and opengl. There is a deprecated pygame only interface and an opengl interface.

Feel free to fork a copy and get your hands dirty!

Check out the Wiki for some <a href="https://github.com/Frostlock/Warrens/wiki/Running-the-game">installation instructions</a>.
